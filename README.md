# AWS-Based Real-Time Taxi Demand Prediction System ðŸš–ðŸ“Š

A scalable, serverless data lake and machine learning pipeline for forecasting NYC Yellow Taxi ride demand using AWS services. This system ingests, transforms, models, and visualizes taxi demand predictions in real-time, delivering actionable insights via interactive dashboards.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end taxi demand forecasting platform leveraging AWS cloud-native services and ML models. It processes trip data from 2023â€“2024, forecasts future demand, and delivers insights through dashboards deployed on Elastic Beanstalk.

---

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack

- **AWS Lambda** â€” Data ingestion & orchestration  
- **AWS Glue** â€” Data processing & ETL  
- **Amazon S3** â€” Centralized data storage (data lake)  
- **AWS Athena** â€” Serverless data querying  
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** â€” Structured storage for transformed and prediction data  
- **Elastic Beanstalk** â€” Streamlit dashboard deployment  
- **LightGBM** â€” ML modeling (lag features, FFT, Prophet forecasts)  
- **Streamlit** â€” Real-time visualization dashboards  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Pipeline Architecture  

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Download raw taxi data via Lambda
   - Store data in an S3 data lake (structured by year/month)

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Trigger AWS Glue jobs for data filtering & transformation
   - Catalog data with Glue Crawlers

3. **ML Modeling**  
   - Query data with Athena for training
   - Train LightGBM models with lag, FFT, and Prophet features
   - Generate demand predictions for 2024

4. **Data Storage**  
   - Store transformed & predicted data in both S3 and PostgreSQL (RDS)

5. **Visualization & Monitoring**  
   - Deploy a Streamlit dashboard on Elastic Beanstalk  
   - Display MAE, MAPE, and demand forecasts for selected locations  
   - Use caching with hourly invalidation
